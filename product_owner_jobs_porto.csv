We’re here because we don’t believe there’s a level playing field that gives small businesses with a fighting chance against the giants of the high street.

**The Team**

  

Não existe apenas uma forma de explicar o que é a Prozis. É um conjunto de revoluções, no mercado, nas pessoas e no valor que criamos todos os dias. Perfeitos? Não é exatamente o que procuramos ser. Tenacidade é talvez a nossa competência mais importante. De alguma forma isto faz sentido para ti? Queres saber um pouco mais? Se sim, junta\\-te a nós e \\#ExceedYourself mas avisamos já: a Prozis não é para todos!


**The Role \\-** **Operador de Distribuição**


Desde 2019 que estamos a criar aquela que é uma das derradeiras formas de interação com o cliente. Durante vários anos mudamos a vida das pessoas e todos os dias saíam do nosso armazém milhares de encomendas. Em boa verdade, nunca nos faltou determinação, apenas a *last mile.*


É exatamente isso que fazemos com a Prozis NOW. Preparamos as encomendas, cada vez mais próximos dos nossos clientes. Estamos presentes em cada vez mais centros urbanos, onde preparamos as encomendas com maior rapidez e surpreendemos mais e mais clientes: dia após dia.

  

Isso implica que, diariamente, pessoas como tu e eu, todos juntos, temos a responsabilidade de, ao longo do dia (e noite), recolher todos os maravilhosos artigos que desenvolvemos, para os podermos preparar e embalar, sendo por fim entregues aos nossos clientes que ansiosamente esperam por eles nas suas casas, locais de trabalho, ginásios, ...


Desengana\\-te se pensas que é uma tarefa simples e que só vendemos proteína e manteiga de amendoim. Sabias que só no ano passado, criamos milhares de novos produtos? Muitos corredores e prateleiras a percorrer para selecionar as melhores escolhas dos nossos clientes.


Ter a encomenda pronta é só metade do caminho. Nunca viste as nossas carrinhas Prozis ou motas Prozis na tua cidade? Dão bem nas vistas. Vermelhas, bonitas e carregadinhas de coisas boas.


Se tudo isto faz sentido para ti, porque não nos vens conhecer melhor?

  

**You**


É importante que tenhas algumas características que nos permitam perceber se tens o \\#ExceedYourself necessário.


Vamos tornar as coisas simples (para já!): ser boa pessoa e um bom profissional costumam ser suficientes para ter sucesso.


Mas tudo isto é muito vago. Estamos de acordo. Temos a certeza que tens muito para nos ensinar. Nós também te podemos ajudar em algumas coisas. Humildade para aprender o que fazemos com gosto e uma mão cheia de determinação e energia para o fazer com vontade, são os ingredientes secretos.  

  

É importante que saibas utilizar um computador e telemóvel além de pesquisar na internet pelos nossos produtos ou pelas últimas novidades no nosso site e app. **O****brigatoriamente** experiência na condução de motociclos/veículos ligeiros, com carta de condução para o efeito, assim como, conhecer a envolvente urbana do centro e do grande Porto.

  

Se já tiveres experiência nestas andanças, temos ainda mais curiosidade para saber. Partilha isso connosco!


Todos os dias acontecem coisas novas, diferentes e ainda mais desafiantes. Nem sempre é fácil, mas também ninguém disse que era.


A equipa? É o principal em tudo o que fazemos.


O melhor de todos? É o colega do lado. Ele vai ajudar\\-te sempre que precisares. **Prometes fazer o mesmo?**


**Local de Trabalho:** Porto, Portugal  

  

**Oferta / Benefícios em vigor:**

  

* Ainda há coisas que não podem ser tão descontraídas como a Prozis: para isso usamos os contratos. Terás um quando vieres para cá!


* Somos competitivos. Temos alguns benefícios para que te sintas bem na empresa: seguro de saúde, refeições grátis, café grátis, descontos no site e café... sim, o café é grátis!


* Se fizeres entregas, usarás uma daquelas carrinhas ou motas que te falamos antes;

  

* Um projeto onde verdadeiramente gostamos de estar e trabalhar.

  

**Sabias que?**


Expedimos todos os dias mais de 12000 encomendas para todo o mundo e na sua maioria os nossos clientes encomendam a nossa deliciosa manteiga de amendoim? Como não gostar dela?!


Até breve!
